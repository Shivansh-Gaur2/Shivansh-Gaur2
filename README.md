## 🧠 Engineering Profile

Software Development Engineer with a strong focus on **backend systems, distributed architecture, and high-throughput data pipelines**.

I enjoy working close to the metal of real systems — designing **scalable APIs**, **data transformation engines**, and **real-time infrastructure** that hold up under load.

My work philosophy:
- Build systems that scale before they break  
- Optimize for **clarity, extensibility, and correctness**
- Treat architecture as a first-class citizen, not an afterthought
